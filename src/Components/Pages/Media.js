        <h1> How we can assist you</h1>
        <p>Unions train and organise workplace representatives who help union members with the problems they face at work.

        Reps provide support and advice and campaign for better conditions and pay.
        
        Unions have brought significant changes to society, including:
        
        a national minimum wage;
        the abolition of child labour;
        improved worker safety;
        improving living standards by reducing the number of hours in the working week and encouraging a healthy work/life balance;
        improved parental leave;
        equality legislation;
        better protection of migrant workers and a reduction in exploitation;
        minimum holiday and sickness entitlements.
        Unions have also made thousands of local agreements on issues affecting individual workplaces following consultation, negotiation and bargaining.</p>

        That’s great, but how does it work in practice?
        When you’re a member of the CSA, you’re part of a family that will always stand up for you. We have highly trained staff and activists who understand exactly what rights you have and what employers are allowed to do.
        
        We train our people in employment law, health and safety and how to represent people in disciplinary processes so that whenever there is a problem, someone has your back. Those activists are commonly referred to as ‘Reps’ or ‘workplace organsiers’.
        
        On every workplace issue, from individuals facing disciplinaries, to bullying at work, to making sure you get proper maternity or paternity rights or simply making sure that your workplace is a safe place to be – CSA is here for our members.
        When working people speak together, our voice is so much stronger than when we do it alone. With over a large number of members across South Africa and tens of thousands of trained reps and hundreds of staff, together we have the power to make a real difference.

        CSA does that every day – negotiating with employers on behalf of our members and campaigning for better jobs, better rights and better workplace policies.

        Everybody one in the workplace needs to take a more active approach to health and safety. 
        But the part that workers and employees need to lead is health and safety reps.
       We really need is good health and safety full stop.
        
        A good health and safety system needs an effective regulator, workers able to influence health and safety in their workplace and businesses showing positive leadership.
        
        Affilliated unions emphasized the crucial importance of strengthening South Africa’s weak worker participation. 
        
        Workers electing their own health and safety representatives is of benefit to the workplace, regardless of the size of firm or the industry they work in. Everyone should be able to participate in their own health and safety at work.
        
        The most significant changes included:
        
        Bigger fines for “non-compliance”
        A new definition of “officers who carry a liability” – in effect, a broader definition of who is responsible for health and safety in a given workplace.
        More explicit emphasis on managing risk in the first place
        Greater powers for health and safety representatives. However health and safety reps need to achieve a new Unit Standard in order to be authorised to use those powers under the new law.
        Any worker can ask to have health and safety representative in their workplace. But workplaces with more than 20 employees or those in high risk inudstry must have reps and must have an election to choose them.
        
        Everybody one in the workplace needs to take a more active approach to health and safety. But the part that workers and employees need to lead is health and safety reps.

         <h1> Health and Safety </h1>
         For health and safety reps to be permitted to exercise their full powers under the new Health and Safety at Work Act, they need to have completed some approved training. Worksafereps has been delivering health and safety representative training since 2003, and is currently the largest provider of this training in Aotearoa.

Worksafereps can deliver health and safety training for the new Unit Standard.

They have trained people working in a wide range of industries. Their strenghts include:



Insecure work, for most people, means their lives are dominated by work: waiting for it, looking for it, worrying when they don’t have it. They often don’t have paid holidays – which can mean no holidays at all. They lose out on family time. They often don’t have sick leave. They are vulnerable if they try to assert their rights or raise any concerns. They are exposed to dangerous working conditions and have to accept low wages. They can’t make commitments.
